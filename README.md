# nvd-api
An open source, public, and free API to the National Institute for Technology's National Vulnerability Database: https://nvd.nist.gov/

### Overview 
* The National Vulnerability Database (or NVD) is an extremely valuable resource that provides regularly updated details on known vulnerabilites and the products that they affect. 
* The NVD can be queried with a user friendly search interface, but the maintainers do not offer an API for machine to machine queries.
* The NVD also offers regularly updated data files free of charge.
* The NVD API project seeks to expose the entirety of the existing NVD as well as regularly integrate NVD updates over a RESTful API free of charge for consumers.
* The NVD-API project seeks to provide an open source option for those wishing to integrate NVD database results into their product.
